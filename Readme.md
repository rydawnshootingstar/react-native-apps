# React Native!
The time has come for me to learn the little differences in working with React Native to compile to native android and IOS apps. I've been doing a little bit of reading about the difference between making just one browser-friendly Progressive Web App and a native app, and it seems worth learning, especially if the project calls for a mobile-first (or only) experience. I still get to use React/JS instead of Java for Android and I don't have to bother learning Swift/Objective-C for IOS. Seems like a no-brainer. 

## This Repo
Will hold all of my beginner React Native projects.
